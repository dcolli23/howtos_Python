# Pipenv

https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/

## Exiting Pipenv Environment

Since `pipenv` starts a new shell session with the `virtualenv` pathing instead of changing the pathing in the current shell. You have to actually exit the shell by using the `exit` command or by typing <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd>.

## Make a note of Visual Studio environment integration as well
